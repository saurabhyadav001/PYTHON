# print("saurabh")
# print('yadav') 
#in python we can use single as well as double code too represent an string.

# print("saurabh 'yadav' cse ") #we can use double or in-between single as well as single code in between double.
# print('saurabh "yadav" cse') #as well as we can't use same codes in between same codes .

#TUTORIal 10 ----*********ESCAPES SEQUENCES*********

#*****In Python, escape sequences are indicated by a backslash ( \ ). The most important one may be \n which indicates a new line. ... 
# Another escape sequence worth mentioning is \' for a single quote within a string. A backslash also escapes itself so if it's really a backslash you want,
# double it as in*** \\ .

#using backslash '\' avoids giving syntax error when we use same codes between same codes.
#  \' ------- Single quote , \"--Double Quote , \\-- backlash, \n, \t, \b--backspace.
# print ('saurabh \n yadav \n cse ')
# print('this is backslash\\ \n this is doubele backslash \\\\')
# print('Line A \\n Line B')   #**Escapes Sequences As a Normal Text.**
# print("\\\" \\\'")
#EXERCISE 01********
# print(' these are /\\/\\/\\/\\ mountains')
# print ('he is \t awesome')
# print('\\\"\\\' \\')

#***RAW STRING --- USING RAW STRING WE CAN TREAT AN ESCAPE SEQUENCE AS A NORAMAL TEXT.

#***************VARAIABLES*******
#python is dynamic programming lang, here we do not need to declare that any variable type ex.
#int , char , float etc.. so, python gives flexibily in terms of declaring variable types.

# name = 'saurabh'
# print(name)

# name = 12345
# print(name)
#variable name can't start with any number or any special character.
 
# user_one_name= "saurabh"    #snake case writing  **recommended for PYTHO
# userOneName= "Yadav"  # camel case writing.
