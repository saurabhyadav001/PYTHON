# You are given a list li[] of N integers. The task is to find the smallest positive natural number missing from the list.

n = int(input())
numbers = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
numbers.sort()
result = 1

for n in numbers:
    if n != result:

    result += 1

print(result)


Question ---2

# Write a program to take an integer N and print the sum of all its even digits and sum of all its odd digits separately.

num = [int(a) for a in str(input())]
even_sum = 0
odd_sum = 0

for i in num:
    if i % 2 == 0:
        even_sum = even_sum + i
    else:
        odd_sum = odd_sum + i

print(even_sum, odd_sum)


Question----3



# Write a Python program to create a word guessing game kind of like Hangman. Program should do the following operations:

# a) Program chooses random word from list of words.

# b) Limited guesses before game ends.

# c) Addresses repeats when guessing.

# d) Displays progress after each guess

import random

words = ['american', 'restaurant', 'programming', 'computer']
random_word = random.choice(words)
count = 0
attempt_list = []

    guess = str(input('Guess a letter: ')).lower()

    if guess not in attempt_list:
        if guess in random_word:
            print('Its in the word')
        else:
            count += 1
            print('Not in word, attemps: {}'.format(count))

            if count >= 5:
                print('\nYou have reached max attempts')
                print('Sorry, but hangman died! You lose')
                break
    else:
        print('You already guessed {}. Try again'.format(guess))
        print(set(attempt_list))

    attempt_list.append(guess)
